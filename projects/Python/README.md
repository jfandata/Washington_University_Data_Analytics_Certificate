# PyBank and PyPoll
These projects are part of the Data Analytics and Visualization Certification at Washington University in St. Louis.  Other projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/jfandata/Washington_University_Data_Analytics_Certificate).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The objective of the projects is to use Python scripting skills to analyze real world situations. The purpose of PyBank is to analyze company financial records and financial performance over time. In the project PyPoll, the purpose is to count and analyze voting data to determine the winner of the election. 

### Methods Used
* Python scripts

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
PyBank: create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll: create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
