#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is analyze district-wide standardized test results. Data is aggregated to show obvious trends in school performance. The school board will be using these results to make strategic decisions regarding the future schoold budgets and priorities. 

### Methods Used

* Array calculations

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook 

## Project Description
This project uses the Pandas library to manipulate data into tables that allow for aggregating and summarizing of district and school data. Array calculations are performed to create a snapshot of school district's key metrics. Analysis done to show trends such as top peforming schools, bottom performing schools, math and math scores by grade, and scores by school spending, size, and school type.
